  <h2>ABOUT CONFERENCE</h2>
  <p>In the face of climate change, resource depletion, and increasing regulatory pressure, manufacturing
SMEs are at a pivotal point of transformation. Building Circular Futures aims to explore how these
enterprises can embed sustainability into their operations by integrating circular economy practices.
The initiative focuses on capacity building, policy support, and innovative technologies—such as
Industry 4.0 tools, IoT, and blockchain—to facilitate this shift. The program underscores the
importance of collaborative ecosystems, involving vendors, customers, policymakers, and research
institutions, to drive sustainable manufacturing. It also emphasizes education, training, and researchdriven frameworks to help SMEs overcome challenges like lack of awareness, high upfront costs, and
limited access to green technologies. Ultimately, the vision of Building Circular Futures is to create a
resilient, low-carbon manufacturing ecosystem that not only benefits businesses but also contributes
positively to environmental and social well-being</p>
